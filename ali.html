        <p>On March 21, 2002 I was waiting in Chicago's O'Hare airport for my plane to Munich Germany so I could study abroad
         for 30 days with a group of Millikin University students led by Dr. Lynda Hoffman-Jeep &mdash;"The Frau."  Who 
        was sitting in a terminal waiting for a plane?  Only the greatest boxer of all time.</p>

        <p>Myself and another male student were the first to actually approach him (even though
        a crowd had gathered).  We introduced ourselves and said we were big fans and would like to shake his hand 
        and also apologized for bothering him.  He kinda laughed and said "no problem" and he kinda talked to us 
        for a bit.  He even did a few magic tricks for the large crowd.  Even though his disease had limited him
        to some degree, he still was the great Ali.  Someone in the crowd suggested that we take a photo since we happened
        to have a camera and Mr. Ali obliged.</p>

        <p>So, here's the picture scaled down to fit (click for larger version).  Someone once suggested that I could probably
        send Mr. Ali the original photo and get an autograph.  And he is probably nice enough to his fans that he would accommodate
        this request.  But I figure why ask for an autograph?  I got to shake the hands of the greatest boxer of all time.  That
        is good enough for me.</p>
